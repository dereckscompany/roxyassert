# roxyassert 0.4.0

* New `class<Name>` type for asserting an object's class, generating
  `assert_class(x, "Name")`. It works for any of R's object systems (S3, S4,
  Reference Classes, R6, S7) and for any class you define yourself, and it
  matches subclasses, so `class<AbstractClock>` accepts a `RealClock`. `Name` is
  a single class (no `pkg::` qualifier — name the package in prose if useful).
* Breaking: the `R6<Class>` type is removed in favour of the more general
  `class<Class>` (identical generated check).
* Class names are not verified at `document()` time: a typo such as
  `class<Duraton>` generates without complaint and fails at runtime.

# roxyassert 0.3.1

* R6 contract generation now works on roxygen2 7.x as well as 8.x. The method
  detection no longer calls roxygen2's internal `r6_tag_type()` (added in
  8.0.0); it derives the same method-vs-class classification directly from the
  tag and class source lines, so packages pinned to roxygen2 7.3.x can
  generate R6 method contracts.

# roxyassert 0.3.0

* New `@type` tag: declare a reusable named type/shape once and reference it by
  name anywhere a type appears (`@return (promise<OrderAck>)`, `(Bps)`,
  `list<OrderAck>`), instead of repeating the annotation. Names resolve at
  `document()` time by inline expansion (no runtime cost); a `@type` may build on
  another, with cycles and unknown names reported as errors. Package-local.
  Use-site refinement of a named type (e.g. `(Price in [0, 1])`) is not supported
  in this version — see Known limitations in the README.

# roxyassert 0.2.0

* New `promise<T>` type (and the `T | promise<T>` union), most natural on
  `@return`, for functions whose result may be delivered synchronously **or** as
  a `promises::promise`
  that resolves to the same value (e.g. an exchange wrapper with an `async`
  switch). roxyassert generates a plain value-validator for the resolved type
  `T` and stays promise-agnostic — you compose the async yourself
  (`promises::then(impl, assert_return_fn)`, or your own sync/async helper).

# roxyassert 0.1.0

Initial release.

`roxyassert` is a roxygen2 roclet: at `document()` time it reads structured type
annotations in your `@param` / `@return` documentation and writes per-function
assertion helpers (calls to the [`assert`](https://github.com/dereckscompany/assert)
package) into `R/contracts-generated.R`, so a function's documented contract and
its runtime validation come from a single source.

## Features

* `contract_roclet()` — register it in `DESCRIPTION`
  (`Roxygen: list(roclets = c("namespace", "rd", "roxyassert::contract_roclet"))`)
  to generate `assert_args_<fn>()` and `assert_return_<fn>()` for every documented
  function with a typed `(...)` annotation; untyped tags are left untouched, so
  adoption is incremental.
* A bespoke, self-contained annotation grammar (see `vignette("grammar")`):
  - bare atomics as vectors, `scalar<>` / `vector<..., length>` shapes, and the
    `any` wildcard;
  - `in [interval]` (ISO/Bourbaki open/closed brackets, `±Inf` sentinels) and
    `in c(set)` / bare-constant sets, with values copied **verbatim** — no coercion;
  - `| NA` (element-level) and `?` / `| NULL` (whole-argument) modifiers, and
    `|` type unions;
  - composite records and typed `data.table` / `data.frame` columns via nested
    `- name (type)` bullets, and homogeneous `list<T>`;
  - reference types `function` and `R6<Class>`.
* R6 method contracts: methods documented inline generate
  `assert_args_<Class>__<method>()` / `assert_return_<Class>__<method>()`.
* Annotation text is read from each tag's raw source, so the grammar's `<...>`
  and `[...]` survive roxygen2's `markdown = TRUE` processing.

## Notes

* The generated helpers call `assert::*` by bare name; make `assert` an import of
  your package (see the README).
